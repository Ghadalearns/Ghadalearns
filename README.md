# About me

I'm Ghada, a Translator and Localizer 🌍✨  
Currently diving into Computer Science.  
I love working on localization for apps, games, and websites — making digital products feel truly native.  
I share my little projects and learning journey here. Stick around if you're into tech, language, or both!

Thanks for stopping by 💖
